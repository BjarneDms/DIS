This file contains the details and run order of the src scripts.

1. Run these scripts in a virtual environment (venv) with Python version 3.12
2. In the terminal run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all packages
3. Run the script 'main.py' to run:
    - network.py -> data generation
    - Part1.py -> data cleaning
    - Part2.py -> categorization
    - experiment1.py
    - experiment2.py
Any of these script can be turned off in main.py

4. All data generated from these scripts is stored in the data folder.
    Beware that anytime these scripts are ran, data will be generated.

5. The project comes with the data used in the experiments of the report.
    Running main.py will not be necessary for that

6. The remaining scripts serve only as scripts to be called by the ones previously mentioned.
